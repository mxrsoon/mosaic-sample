# Mosaic
WIP framework for building portable JavaScript apps inspired by Android, UWP and Flutter.

After some more progress in development, this readme will be updated.

# Getting started
You can use [Mosaic's CLI tool](https://github.com/wazybr/mosaic-cli) to start building applications with the framework.

# Documentation
Mosaic's (under construction) documentation can be found [here](https://wazybr.github.io/mosaic-docs/).

# Sample application
A very simple application using Mosaic can be seen [here](https://wazybr.github.io/mosaic-sample/). It will be updated as the framework evolves and you can see it's source at [wazybr/mosaic-sample](https://github.com/wazybr/mosaic-sample).
