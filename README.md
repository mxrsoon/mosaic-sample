# Mosaic
WIP framework for building portable JavaScript apps inspired by Android, UWP and Flutter.

After some more progress in development, this readme will be updated.

# Documentation
Mosaic's (incomplete) documentation can be found [here](https://wazybr.github.io/mosaic-docs/).

# Sample application
A very simple application using Mosaic can be seen [here](https://wazybr.github.io/mosaic-sample/). It will be updated as the framework evolves.
